Do not let the cover fool you; Drew Barrymore is not in this movie. 

I am going to assume (for both the sake of the filmmaker and myself) that all of the dialogue is improve. If that is NOT the case, it would mean that everything was shot in a single take where the actors were constantly forgetting their lines and screaming ""FUCK"" as loudly as they could to replace the written dialogue. 

This torture session is a crime against cinema. 

It should be punishable under the Geneva Convention.

2019-02-19,You Were Never Really Here,2017,https://letterboxd.com/gasoline/film/you-were-never-really-here/,4,,"""You just hate women directors""

This was so close to being a masterpiece. Shot for shot it's just so cleanly executed. Until the end. That stupid fucking ending that's telegraphed from a million miles away because every female director feels the need to 'subvert the genre' by having the FRAGILE YOUNG GIRL become the REAL HERO who DON'T NEED NO MAN. 

It's not subversion to do what everyone expects. It's not unique or interesting to portray a woman in a state of vulnerability and then have her be the one who saves herself at the end. It's the same story that everyone is writing now. 

If she had just told the story of the girl, I think that would have been compelling. Or if she had actually followed through with the Joe character and gave him something of an ending. But instead we get the same trite story being told with a different wrapper. 

I get it. Women can be strong too and they don't need a man to save them. We all get it. Now can we go back to telling a story? One that doesn't have to rely on an 'edgy' narrative hook?",,

The P90X segment was nice until it became a very long bit about male prison rape 🙄. 

The long segment about becoming a pharmacist also should have been funny? I really don't understand why none of this is landing for me. It seems to be well written? And she's clearly really energetic and brings a lot of physicality to her work. Specifically for this bit, I even enjoy the topic. 

But this is one of the more boring specials I've seen. 

I think there's a point where having a bunch of energy comes off as desperately wanting the audience to enjoy your very mediocre content. 

""I don't care what the Brits eat, we won the war."" Just......what is my response to be to this? 

Wow, she just said the N word. 

""I think they fucking do use nutmeg and that's why it burns so much"" This was the punchline to a 5 minute(maybe? Maybe longer? I'm starting to lose sight of time) bit about how a particular KY jelly burns. 

There's a pattern where her jokes all tend to speed up as they go on. It's like she's trying to outrun her own jokes. 

I think the problem is that nothing she says is unique or surprising in any way. I know where every bit is going when it begins. ",,2020-01-05

I hate not giving a little higher of a rating since the highs on this one are fantastic. 

The middle portion had some really fantastic crowd work as well as some very tightly constructed and well delivered bits. 

However this loses two stars due to the more performative moments towards the end of the special during the third act. Specifically the songs in the club parts were awkward to sit through. Just a little too over the top for my tastes.",,2020-01-06

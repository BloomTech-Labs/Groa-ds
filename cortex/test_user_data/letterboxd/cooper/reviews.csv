2012-09-22,Dredd,2012,https://letterboxd.com/tabula_rasta/film/dredd/,2,,"I approached Dredd expecting a certain level of kitschy action-movie fare. Over-the top violence, slow-motion action sequences, at least one likable character, cheesy but fun one-liners, et al.

In every area I can think of, Dredd failed to meet my rather low standards for the action movie it was advertised as.

First of all, the main character has no character. This becomes a problem when determining how much I care about the outcome of the film. About two jokes are attempted in the whole movie, provoking a guffaw from only the lowest of plebeian audience members.

The music works, at a basic level. It's like a someone trying to replicate the Dark Knight soundtrack with Garageband and a keyboard. In all fairness, it fits the tone of the movie.

Throughout the film, the cinematography is the best money can buy. But a slow-mo sequence early on makes big promises that the rest of the film doesn't keep. There are three truly beautiful shots of bullets going through flesh at 1% speed. At that point, the producers seemingly nodded in unison and decided that would do for the remaining hour and a half of the movie. All other slow-motion is reserved for extended falling sequences, each of which wears out its welcome after about 1000 CG sparkles.

Dredd fits nicely into the pseudo-intellectual sci-fi genre, along with predecessors Surrogates (2009) and Gamer (2009). It's a good excuse for morons to say ""it makes you think"" without the firing of a single neuron. The moral issues are established as a theme, then skirted about without a second thought. All in all, Dredd is meathead material and certainly not worth the price of admission.","meh, meathead",2012-09-22
2012-09-23,Man Bites Dog,1992,https://letterboxd.com/tabula_rasta/film/man-bites-dog/,5,,"In conversations with many a self-proclaimed film buff, I have noticed a trend, particularly pervasive among males aged 15-27. It is considered very cool indeed to enjoy ""dark comedy "" or ""black humor"". Many consider themselves cultured and sophisticated for seeing comedy in death. I can’t claim any distance from such affections. But I cannot shake the feeling that the very nature of dark comedy is unclear to many of its proponents. When asked, if they answer at all they will invariably say something to this effect: ""Dark humor is empowering because it makes sense of awful things. I laugh, therefore I have power over the pain portrayed.""

Man Bites Dog (Belvaux, 1992) is perhaps the greatest challenge to this notion, and one that I would never have the balls to conjure up. Like many (or perhaps all) great works of art, it is at once a picture and a mirror. The term ""man bites dog"" originates in journalism, and refers to the fact that a dog biting a man is not newsworthy, but the unusual role reversal is. The film sees a skeleton camera crew that follows Ben (Benoît Poelvoorde), a serial killer, as he performs his bloody work. He gleefully kills men and women, elderly people and children. The film crew gradually become accomplices to the killer's atrocities, as does the audience, borne on the shoulders of a documentary cameraman.

The film establishes itself as shockingly violent in the first couple minutes. The seasoned filmist may be initially more amused than horrified. The dialogue is very clever, ingenious actually. I laughed out loud more than once. The main character impeccably embodies sardonic hedonism. The supporting characters are jovially nonplussed by the violence enacted, mirroring…guess who? As the film progressed, my laughter came with more and more guilt. I realized I was playing a poker game of moral sensibilities against an opponent who had no qualms. When the cards were on the table at the end of the movie, I couldn’t believe the depths of hell to which I’d been pulled. Ben loaded his Bruni 1911 with my chuckles and popped them into my heartless chest, one by one.

Man Bites Dog means business for those who consider themselves a fan of dark comedy. I would submit that it’s more compelling than its cousin, Haneke’s Funny Games, because instead of wallowing in smugness, it systematically convinces the viewer of his own emotions simply by inducing them. Inglourious Basterds makes a similar point about the human capacity for schadenfreude, but ultimately indulges us in our bloodlust. Here, the violence is not titillating, but documentary. Its objectivity gives us no excuse for our reaction. We see that perhaps the dark comedy urge is not the cure, but the disease. Rather than using it to cope with death and pain, we revel in it.

This experience has left its mark on me as the most well-made film I never want to see again. In a way, I’m glad I’ve been given this lesson. It seems everyone has a personal doctrine regarding his own consumption of violence. Half-sheepishly, half rebelliously, many like me have resigned themselves to quaffing fake blood and dispassionate one-liners. But there’s a niggling feeling in the back of our minds, that perhaps we’re not strong enough, that we won’t be contented for long before moving up to the next degree of vicarious visions. Sometimes we need a shock like this to reveal our own weaknesses.","horrifying, perfect, graphic, ingenious, disturbing",

It's the kind of thing that aims to make people like Del Boy extol its undeniable fuckingawesomeness. No offense to Mr. Boy. I feel that the producers saw Joss Whedon's affinity for exploiting genre clichés, and paid him to pull out all the stops. It's like paying a CSI expert to perform the perfect murder. Audiences everywhere bought it.

Deconstruction may be a good place to start.

1) Effects

The cinematography here is, in a sense, the best that money can buy. It does the job without any subtlety, which is no problem. Likewise, the CG was pretty spectacular for the most part. But with a production of this magnitude, I can't help but be confused at times. What's with Loki's godawful costume? Everything he does dredges up memories of sparkly Zeus in Clash of the Titans. Or that otherworldly dimension that looks like a laser tag arena, its sole inhabitant a leper from 300? Really selling it, buddy.

And that's just the surface.


2) Writing

The characters are oft compromised for the sake of driving plot or telling a joke. Also, Shakespeare in the Park was horrific until Robert Downey Jr. called it that. 'Twas truly hilarious.


3) Plot

Tons of boring, tired exposition. The last 30 minutes dragged on spectacularly.

The first time I saw it, I was amped for more of the brilliantly interlaced plot line with a compelling commentary on society. Instead, TDKR was more of a satisfaction of what could sell to audiences. Beyond the many nonsensical decisions by otherwise competent characters and the apparent aversion to exploring poverty and anarchy in depth, the movie was a good theatre experience and a fitting end to the series.

And by that, I mean the end. People don't seem to get that the Robin reference was bringing us full circle rather than plugging a sequel.

2013-01-07,Les Misérables,2012,https://letterboxd.com/tabula_rasta/film/les-miserables-2012/,2.5,,"Somewhere amidst a painfully long take, as the camera attempted a tonsillectomy on Hugh Jackman, I realized something. What I saw was as much a film as Michael Jordan was a baseball player. It looks like a film. Sounds like a film. But by golly if it isn't just a bad musical. As Jeff Overstreet has noted, Hugh Jackman does not sing. He brays. The cast sold tickets but was terrible for a musical that tries so hard to be a serious film. Where a more sensible musical movie would supplement the vocals with some dance choreography, the director of this film opted for tortuous close-ups in the style of acne cream commercials. Fantine's epic tear-jerker notwithstanding, these solos wore out their welcome very quickly.

Les Miserables has more than its fair share of emotional confusion, another product of a failed fusion of two media.

I expected less restraint from a Takashi Miike film, as he is a director who's earned a reputation for excess. But this film is wonderfully subtle while illuminating many details not present in the original. There are several new hints in this version. The half-rotted fruit brought home on Motome's body, soaked in blood, is a great visual of the upper class. The white cat helped tie together the relationship between the corrupt samurai code and the woes of the poor.

I had anticipated the great battle with the three retainers the entire movie, and when it came it wasn't really a battle at all. I suppose this could be said to reinforce the cowardice we see in their hearts, but to me it felt like a disappointment. Miike's Hanshiro doesn't seem to carry the jaded control and bitter sarcasm that Kobayashi's character conveys. The vitriol is replaced with desperation. Once again, this does support Miike's vision for the story, and is really only a personal issue.

I loved that this version pits Hanshiro against the clan with only a wooden sword in the end. It's a really powerful scene: to see a man with nothing to lose, proving with every harmless slap of a stick that the men he is fighting are utter cowards. He says he treasures his sword more than anything, and when he draws it, we know exactly what he means.

You know what? Maybe this version is better. The frame tale seems a tad too long in this version, but maybe that's because I knew exactly what would happen to the family ahead of time. That aside, I loved this film, and for different reasons than I expected.",,2013-03-22

Roger Deakins trains his ever-impeccable eye on this tale, framing puffed-up characters against the backdrop of open skies and landscapes. Our subjects are larger than life up close, but tiny in perspective of the world they fancy themselves lords of. As the film progresses, the allure of celebrity fades to shameful paranoia and defeat.

Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck were perfectly cast, giving performances of incredible depth. Jesse James is a masculine and imposing tiger of a man. Robert Ford's skulking neuroses are a subtle fascination, tightly winding up in that clockwork, obsessive mind. It's a slow burn, this relationship. I've rarely seen such delicately painted personalities in a western, if you can call this a western at all.

Here's the rub: the narration in this film was like a caption in Comic Sans on the Mona Lisa. Just when we are exploring the nuances of the characters' actions and the twitches of their faces add up to that coiled drama, THE NARRATOR appears to explain the joke. The very tone of voice sounds insulting; it digs up carefully buried subtext to throw it in a heap. Even at the most useless of times, he seems to show up. ""He drinks the water from the glass on the mantel..."" Guess what the character does on screen.

There is only one possible excuse for this stylistic choice that I can conceive of. The film is replete with shots reminiscent of a stereoscope curiosity box (of which the film makes mention towards the end). The aberrations around the edges of some frames remind us that we are merely peering into a dusty old story from America's curious past. The narration could be said to contribute to this motif, but it made me roll my eyes. It took me out of the film, and for my part I'm withholding a star.",,2013-03-26

2013-03-28,Breathless,1960,https://letterboxd.com/tabula_rasta/film/breathless/1/,4,,"Breathless deals a bold blow to the mainstream movie-watching mindset. Audiences are primed for movies with clear-cut plot points, likable characters, and a satisfyingly meaningful ending. Instead, the film frustrates these narrative desires that we had taken for granted. The first major event, the murder of a cop by the main character, abruptly occurs amidst an alienating and meandering soliloquy. The scene is jarring and confusingly dispassionate. The rest of the film would seem to the casual viewer to suffer from more egregious pacing issues, as an uneventful bedroom scene is extended before the characters ride around the town accomplishing nothing. This serves both to teach the audience of its own expectations and to concentrate on the bewildering characters.

These characters are self-contradictory and off-putting in their emptiness. Patricia and Michel claim to love each other but both try to use each other for self-gratification. This is more clear on Michel’s part, as his chief interest seems to be sensual pleasure through Patricia. Despite this he seems strikingly jaded towards all things, including sex. The ending of the film feels just as hollow as its subjects: Michel has no drive to escape the police; he verbally states his apathy. For the characters, the potential journey from point A to point B simply does not exist in the mainstream sense. Michel is shot by the cops for no reason, and disowns Patricia with his dying breath: “It’s a real scumbag.” This one last insult complements the injury done to the audience’s expectation of meaning in the film: It was all simply a futile rush about town. We tried sitting still, we tried getting in motion, but in the end we collapsed, out of breath.

Regrettably, even the remake is rather lackluster. Promises made at the outset aren't delivered: The plot has none of the classical bombast of the introductory overture.

Where is the chair-tangling tussle with cultists? This film is rather like a slinky held at either end: it stretches out long and is quite limp in the middle.

However, we're not left entirely without our dose of Hitchcockian sensibility. As with the director's previous film, The Trouble With Harry, crime proves an absolute inconvenience to all involved. It interrupts a vacation, an afternoon social call, dinner preparations, and two musical performances. Damned near everything is bungled thanks to some unexplained motive.

In the end, the total tension deflates, divided between two lesser threats. We're left with a dinner party of people entranced by Doris Day singing 'Que Sera"" over and over again. The movie ends abruptly. We wrap 40 seconds from the climax, with a one-liner that is not very funny. Suffice to say, I consider this film one of the lesser Hitchcock efforts.",,2013-04-15
2013-04-17,Taxi Driver,1976,https://letterboxd.com/tabula_rasta/film/taxi-driver/2/,5,,"Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver was released in 1976, after the end of the Vietnam War. This was a time when America was rethinking the posters on its cultural wall. The massacre at My Lai by American troops had been made public years earlier, in 1969. Many citizens felt disillusioned with the idea of America as the ubiquitous “good-guy”. Perhaps, Americans thought, the classic western hero wasn’t the cool, fast-shooting, noble character who always wins. Maybe he’s just… a misguided sociopath. Taxi Driver put this idea neatly into perspective, starring Robert de Niro as the darkly parodical American anti-hero Travis Bickle, who is introduced as a veteran of the Vietnam War. The film explores the depths of his mental instability and self-contradictory value system. By the film’s end, his disturbed mind is glorified by the media, mirroring America’s long-held fascination with the “lone gunslinger” figure. The famous scene of Travis practicing with guns in his room demonstrates this look at the dark side of the classic hero: his guns, heroic duty, and individualism. Scorsese exploits many staples of western heroism, twisting them to reveal a strange and warped mindset beneath.

            In classic Western film, any hero’s best friend is the gun he carries. Travis cultivates an obsession with his guns that might just breach insanity. He desperately wants to be physically adept and good with a gun, like any classic American hero. This obsession is best seen in the famous bedroom scene, where he practices drawing his guns in front of the mirror. The mirror emphasizes his focus on his own machismo. The camera shows Travis shirtlessly twirling his .36 snub before the mirror. It then pans to Travis himself, who dons a M65 Field Jacket and admires his own body. He turns from side to side, clearly enjoying what he sees.

Customarily, a Western hero uses a gun to accentuate his points. He gestures, postures, and proves himself with his weapon. Travis apes these mannerisms in the security of his own room. He practices drawing the gun quickly, quipping, “Faster than you!” On the second attempt, his sleeve gets in the way of the draw and renders his efforts slightly ridiculous. He practices cool, passive superiority whilst clearly in a delusional state of mind. “Your move,” he says tauntingly to the mirror. “You talkin’ to me? Well I’m the only one here. Who the fuck do you think you’re talking to?” A caricature of the heroes he mimics, Travis carries an absurd amount of weapons on his person, rather than the usual single gun. At this point, we have already seen a montage of Travis working out, practicing at a firing range, and equipping his combat paraphernalia. But in the mirror scene, the truly psychological nature of Travis’s obsession comes to light. He is so lonely that he must imagine villains to confront.

            Heroism seems to be at the core of Travis’s fantasies, but it’s a misguided, dead-ended, and farcical heroism. The parallel with film heroes becomes all too apparent in Travis’s room. He makes the camera an accomplice, a witness to his self-glorification. Over a melodramatic monologue, he turns to the audience with a laughable seriousness. When Travis botches the line, a jump cut gives him a second try. “Here is a man…who…here is a man who would not take it any more. Here is a man who stood up!” While the voice-over delivers this epic cliché, the camera shows us Travis lying in the bed in the fetal position. This visual contradiction only serves to make him appear more ludicrous. In mockery of rugged film heroes living in harsh conditions, Travis wears combat boots to bed. Even his signature olive jacket is military-issue.  The irony is accentuated by the fact that he is his very own room. He is captive to his own heroic fantasies.

            This individualism is yet another aspect of the western hero which Scorsese lampoons in this scene. The “Lone Ranger” figure pervades cinema from Batman to Clint Eastwood. He is a noble character who stands alone with no mortal equal. Travis Bickle is a warped reversal of this paradigm: his hatred and self-appointed superiority are focused inward and rebound off the walls. The mirror and the diary both reflect his words of deluded disdain: The phrase, “Listen, you fuckers, you screwheads,” is shown to be merely a line in the diary that Travis keeps. As he practices confrontation before the mirror, his delusions of heroic confrontations become almost masturbatory in nature. After much ado, we cut to a wide-angle view of Travis alone in his room and catch a glimpse of Senator Palantine’s poster on the wall. It becomes increasingly clear that sooner or later, all of Travis’s aggression will be forced outward onto someone. Travis will indeed attempt to assassinate Palantine, an act for which he would be vilified rather than glorified. The final shot of the scene shows him standing once again before the mirror, with crazed eyes, saying, “You’re dead.” The scene ends with tense music and a foreboding sound bridge in the form of a woman’s scream, the diegetic source of which is never revealed.

            As stated before, superiority is a key element of heroic individualism. Travis’s self-image is largely propelled by his disdain for the world from which he is now isolated. He describes himself as “a man who stood up against the scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit.” But we have already seen his self-contradictory behavior. He quotes platitudes about women, yet watches pornography indiscriminately. He belittles “junkies”, yet uses narcotics himself. At another point in the film, he says of himself, “Loneliness has followed me my whole life. Everywhere. In bars, in cars, sidewalks, stores, everywhere. There’s no escape. I’m God’s lonely man…” Travis views himself as almost saintlike in his solitude. He wants a perfect soul as much as he wants a perfect body.

            Paul Schrader, the writer of Taxi Driver, has constructed a remarkably cogent commentary on the American hero through Travis Bickle. He has all the trappings of a “true hero”, yet is clearly one misguided individual. His neuroses and malcontent indicate that he might suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder since his days as a Marine. Unfortunately, the world about him fails to see his problems. He kills a young prostitute’s pimp and his entourage in a spectacular display of rage, and is hailed as a hero by the media and the public. This ending mirrors hero-worship via the media in America. Taxi Driver is, in this sense, a “backstage pass” into the hero psyche. Audiences see protagonists engaging in epic gunfights, but rarely practicing drawing a gun and failing at first. They see heroes exchanging crisp repartee with baddies, but seldom psyching themselves up behind closed doors. They see men killing those that “need” to be killed, but never attempting to assassinate a presidential candidate for no apparent reason. Taxi Driver suggests that the poise and conviction with which Batman and Clint Eastwood deal out violence stems from quite an unnatural source. Television and film have glorified characters who burst in shooting and save the day like Travis does, but in doing so have empowered sociopaths to validate their own violent tendencies. In an even more holistic sense, Taxi Driver can be interpreted as a convincing criticism of America’s involvement in foreign wars like Vietnam. Travis is a personification of American “hero media”, feeding itself with violent fantasies until the end of peacetime. Schrader and Scorcese ask throughout the film, “Who is the man with the gun? What is going on inside his head? And what will he do once there are no more little girls to rescue?”",beware wall of text,
2013-04-19,Gates of Heaven,1978,https://letterboxd.com/tabula_rasta/film/gates-of-heaven/,4.5,,"Gates of Heaven is so tremendously honest, it sometimes feels like a mockumentary. In one of the film's most poignant moments, a man surrounded by dozens of trophies is discussing the successes of his life, when one of the plaques behind him suddenly and without provocation drops off the wall. The tales these people tell are like the wide eyes of a gagged prisoner, silently, hopelessly, begging for freedom. Their lives seem so small against the scrubby, flat expanse of California's fields. When some of them describe the pets, people and things that are meaningful to them, you wonder if they sense their distorted affections as you do. But what could you tell them? Is it such a sin to live a small life?

Part of Errol Morris's genius is manifest in his framing choices. He carefully decorates his characters with the objects they fixate upon. A phone, a cane, a justice scale, a trophy, a tv, a warehouse. As the stories unfold these things tell us about the people and the ephemeral actions they commemorate.

It's not about pet cemeteries. It's about dreams channeled in material things and then taken away. Sit down with someone and try to explain your outlook on life, your affections. You may find yourself a bit like the folks in this documentary. Do you feel small? Because you are.",,2013-04-18

Why, if Superman carries himself with ultimate conviction of humanity's value, is there so little humanity in this film? Even the death of Krypton is more an opportunity for explosions and a brass requiem than it is for any true tragedy. The entire experience boils down to ""sound and fury, signifying nothing"". The characters never stray a millimeter from what is expected. Phenomenally boring exposition spoken by two cardboard father figures. Attempts at emotional buildup between mother and son are ruined by torpid writing. Goyer's stilted dialogue left these fully capable actors flickering emotions like a TV switching channels.

The special effects team is most praiseworthy here: the movie's visuals rival even those of The Avengers. The bombast. The brass. The flare. Snyder's choice to incorporate zooms into CG shots was a good one, until he started pulling the trigger every second. I once counted 4 separate zooms in a single 8-second shot. It's insulting. ""See!"" he whispers. ""The dragon is bleeding! Whatever will happen?""

A Nolan fanboy friend of mine recently texted me the question, ""Do you think Hans Zimmer is the John Williams of our age?"" When was the last time you heard a group of friends humming a Hans Zimmer tune? ""BWOM BWOMMMM--"" Williams threw a whole new set of colors into the films he scored; Zimmer only finds complementary shades. He's  typecast. Man of Steel was furnished with soaring, blazing brass the likes of which we've seen countless times in the last decade. He just... keeps turning it up.

2013-08-01,The Apartment,1960,https://letterboxd.com/tabula_rasta/film/the-apartment/,5,,"My second foray into Billy Wilder's filmography has proven an absolute joy and a fitting end to a wonderful day.  ""This film is perfect."" The phrase is traditionally followed by a checklist of cinematic virtues and superlatives, objectively true but subjectively empty. I'll try a little harder, though it is past my bedtime. 

'The Apartment' overflows with stupefying joy. Jack Lemmon's Baxter strikes one initially as too happy-go-lucky to be anything other than a façade, and it's delightful to realize that amidst shrill Boston accents and throaty adulterers, there's one man who couldn't care less about his troubles. He's the perfect counterpart to a girl like Fran Kubelik. The fact that his corporate ambitions are not really motivated simply prove: he's a giver, not a taker. While Baxter remains stalwart under the burden of a scoundrel's reputation, his sole defect is that he really must grow a pair. This he does with impeccable timing.

The sensual wordplay of Wilder's prior film 'Double Indemnity' reaches full blossom here. Even under the Hays Production Code, the director effortlessly draws the contrast between the uncouth execs and the ever-tactful Baxter. More impressively, every line of this film carries the urgency of a meaningful conversation, if only the viewer is willing to play along.

2013-10-13,Blue Jasmine,2013,https://letterboxd.com/tabula_rasta/film/blue-jasmine/,4,,"**Spoilers**

A week ago, I watched Sandra Bullock tumble haplessly in zero gravity. While her predicament was certainly a nightmare, it always seemed soothingly small compared to the sheer size of the universe. The viewer was tempted, like Dr. Stone, to sink into the warm bosom of blackness.

'Blue Jasmine' is precisely the opposite kind of scary: a claustrophobic character study. Cate Blanchett perfectly embodies the unraveling socialite, in a role not unlike Julianne Moore's in 'Magnolia'. She's a stained glass of cracked pride: the closer we get, the more distorted things look on the other side. Through cleverly interwoven flashbacks, we are allowed to speculate on the facade of Jasmine's past using the raw material left of her in the present.

The film is swimming in squirmy scenes, and sexual harassment is only the beginning. Materialism clogs up Jasmine's world, oozing from her every self-serving groan. Even amongst family, it's clear that personal affluence is the measuring stick of everyone on screen. Even the viewer is not immune to this prejudice, and questions himself by the film's end. The root of it is entitlement. Jasmine's ""good genes"" and ""social skills"" are the mythical horses pulling her chariot of insanity. Even her efforts to ""honest work"" are scuppered by her loftiness, in an ironic way. Her refined airs attract unrefined men.

Jasmine's pride tears families apart. In one of the most memorable shots of the film, Jasmine hopelessly pleads with her son as he flees his home. The camera simply lets the two leave the frame when it can't bear any more. Danny's stare of loathing may be worse, after the twist phone call is revealed and the two stand in the music shop. And still, at her lowest point, Jasmine has the gall to criticize her son's choice of work. Her lazy vitriol takes on new life in everyone she touches.

By the end of the film, the only hope possible rests with Ginger and Chili, drunkenly embracing on the couch. It's a sad hope, but the only one we've got against the terrors that befall Jasmine. And perhaps that's just as well. Ginger's ""lack of self-esteem"" manifests as forgiveness. Chili's a loser, but he'll repent. You can't just earn your second chance.

Gone is the witty repartee between a hobbit and a dragon, robbed of mystery and sense. (This was the one part I was sure to enjoy, and I did for the first 5 minutes.)

In short, anything that did not buckle or swash was patched over with some good ol' CONTENT. Audiences liked the gory parts of LOTR? Let them eat orc heads, freshly cut with increasingly impossible maneuvers. We call it: The Hobbit 2.

Still I hear voices telling me to forget my love of the book: ""appreciate it simply as a fun movie and not an adaptation."" This I cannot do. I have seen student films with better dialogue editing. Ever been tubing on a lake behind a terrible boat driver? The line goes slack for the longest time, then whiplashes you with a titanic jerk. That's how The Hobbit treats its audience. No fun.

And they shattered Gandalf's staff again. What the hell?",,2013-12-20

Likeable solely on account of the two leads. This movie is weighed down by its own seriousness; it needed more jokes, more whip tricks, more moments for god's sake. I miss seeing two characters talk to each other in the space of one shot.

WW wasn't wholly without moments though. The sheer instant giddiness of the ""they don't know that"" shuffle was astounding. How in the hell did that make it past the executive Guardians of Box-office Austerity? And Steve savoring his last few moments alive was pure cinema.

All this to say: we must have Zack Snyder's head, for the sake of everything pure in this corrupted genre. One of Marvel movies' great strengths is their ability to yank the chain back when people take themselves too seriously (Guardians of the Galaxy has this in spades). The DC cinematic universe seems to have missed out on the last two decades of superhero movies and thinks it can still make these old formulas work.",,2017-06-11

I liked a lot of things about this movie. My favorite is that the Mississippi river is both life and death for these characters. As we watch Mud, Ellis, and Ellis's parents learn hard lessons about love, that duality seems all the more crucial. 

Ellis and Neckbone are perfectly cast as scrappy Arkansas boys entranced by boats, guns, and adult magazines. McConaughey with his fucked up tooth and crinkled eyes has an almost angelic quality about him. Nothing in this movie is played for shock value, and nothing is pushed farther than feels natural. I think there's something wrong with me, that I expect 5-star movies to take more risks than this movie does. It's painstakingly crafted to be as honest-to-God as its title suggests. If I watch this again in two decades, 'Mud' will probably ring truer for me.",,2018-01-10

From the director of Kung Fu Panda comes yet another movie with a great storytelling camera and a palpable sense of wonder and loss.

The way they chose to continue after the book left off was daring. There had to be some exploration of the story's key danger: forgetting your childhood. Part of me wanted to learn more about how Mom forgot hers. But in the minds of kid audiences, that would venture into real-life accusatory territory that sours the learning experience. And moreover, it would make it hard to show us such a spectacular set piece in the final act. In the end, I think they made the right choice in revisiting ""Mr. Prince"".

I cried at least twice. Mainly when the girl's birthday rolls around and she shelves yet another snow-globe from her absent father.

2018-04-15,Isle of Dogs,2018,https://letterboxd.com/tabula_rasta/film/isle-of-dogs-2018/,3,,"When The Grand Budapest Hotel came out, some people said it felt like a sickly satire of Wes Anderson movies. I loved the movie and didn't know what they were talking about, but now I want to say that about Isle of Dogs. It just has remarkably little heart for a story about the hope of reconciliation.

The characters don't have chemistry. Most of the time, it's almost as if there is nothing between them but a tussle between pragmatism and stoicism. Several characters are basically the same person in different bodies. Much the same can be said about The Grand Budapest Hotel and Moonrise Kingdom, but since those movies featured live actors, I bought into them more emotionally.

There's also little flow between humor and suspense because, well, there's very little suspense at all. It doesn't help that the Japanese war drums are so overused that they lose their punch by the halfway mark. And this movie has at most a third the humor of any of the previous movies (probably a tenth the humor of Rushmore). Maybe that's because Anderson's constant nods to bureaucratic jargon and museum tours just don't work as jokes anymore.

Obviously the stop-motion craftsmanship is top-notch, but it feels terribly wasted on such an anemic script.",,2018-04-13

The latter's greatest strength was its ability to create surprise by pivoting deftly between pure horror and pure comedy. 'Us' instead tries to blend the two, but in doing so diminishes the effect of both

My first interpretation of the doppelganger family was that they represent the shadow of racist stereotypes that black Americans live under. No matter how successful you get, you're still haunted by the suspicion that racists are right. I've heard black people say as much. Thus you have Gabe in his Howard sweatshirt fighting off an ogreish lookalike who speaks in grunts. The doppelgangers are typified by primal aggressive power, wiliness, and vindictiveness. The Wilsons prevail by using their wits (except, arguably, for the finale struggle).

But this doesn't line up cleanly with the ""hands across america"" part, for one thing. So I have some doubts about this interpretation. Also, on this reading, the ending twist becomes harder to understand.

I don't think I'll watch this again but I am curious to see how people read these themes in the coming weeks.",,2019-03-24
2019-07-10,Hereditary,2018,https://letterboxd.com/tabula_rasta/film/hereditary/,5,,"This movie is so scary that it makes other horror movies seem like mere training for the real deal. It works because it's so physiological. The just audible heartbeats throughout the movie remind your body that you have felt real fear, and that in that moment your armor was stripped away. The animal grief you see in Annie is a human constant to which you have always been subject. For me, this realization came at the moment the movie referenced the Greek tragedy 'The Oresteia'. My 7th Grade class actually read the chorus parts out loud, 20 kids intoning the account of sailors who read evil omens from a rabbit's entrails. I felt dread then. And I carry it with me now.

From the first shot of the movie you are given a glimpse of an eldritch truth: your world is a doll house. You are a grotesque marionette with a string running head to toe. When something pulls on that string, you are suspended in a vertical tension of terror, dangled over an inverted Maslow's hierarchy of needs (Picture a hollow ziggurat turned upside down). The first threat is physiological: your heartbeat is going too fast and it's hard to breathe. Then safety goes. The simplest poor choices become a living nightmare from which sleep is no escape. Death is real. ""Punishment brings wisdom"".

When safety is threatened, we seek shelter in family. But the story we told ourselves about love falls flat so easily. A ""neutral view"" of suffering is no more possible than a redemptive one, because there is a finality of No Closure. That person is gone forever, and they have stopped growing. No more conversation can be had. We have all failed to steward that spirit which is now lost. When Charlie asked ""who will take care of me?"" she was prodigiously grasping this concept that haunts Annie. And as the mother floundered for words, it became clear that Charlie must save herself. The demon came as a shimmer in the moonlight, and the child answered the call.

The evergreen paradigm of adulthood is that of an escape from childhood. You explain away your fears, let go of your fantasies, and habituate adult behaviors. You may feel a freedom from the mistakes your parents made and an assurance that you have already transcended them. But old symbols do not give up their power. When your child asks you about death, you remember that the answer you had ready is a just-so story. If it doesn't work for them, they may side with your parents. And so your spiritual achievement is laid bare and surpassed by a truth that children understand and adults drink to forget. How can you help Charlie if you cannot even help yourself?

What is it that children grasp for, if love is not enough? What Paimon promises, of course. Secret knowledge, good familiars, dignities, lordships, and hidden treasures. Is it not better to reign in hell than to serve in heaven? Choose your words carefully, because no one is deaf to Paimon's siren song. The battle lines are drawn across generations.

What this cross-generational pact has conjured will deal the death-blow to your sanity. That choosing beings young and old will choose to reign in hell is your final notice that you live in a doll house. Self-actualization, prestige, well-being, and progress are not just fleeting, they are a narrative film that congeals on the mammal brain. A devil has dominion. 

Every sphere in this cosmos is a synecdoche of a greater failure. At the center is the neck of a dead bird in Charlie's senile scissors. Just above, the low ceiling of Annie's marriage and her failed abortion. Above, Ellen's best-laid plans to sacrifice her family. Above her, the lustful demon who personifies Nash equilibria in the state of nature. And above that? In the cosmic attic, something is smashing its creation, ""tired of looking at it"".

Don't get me wrong, I'm no Schopenhauer. The above is my interpretation of Ari Aster's vision. I am (or feel) committed to truth, goodness, and beauty. But the fact remains that at age 24, I have never lost someone close to me. Historically speaking, that is wonderfully lucky. We live in an age when more people than ever can avoid trauma and spend more time with those they love. <a href=""https://imgur.com/PhgHeNu"">This GIF on child mortality says a lot.</a>

If the human race survives another thousand years, it may have a chance at transcending the specter of death and writing a new chapter of meaning in life. But that's not the point. The point is this: those who practice goodness must choose to do so regardless of the outcome. This is a secular Pascal's Wager to those who recognize that cosmic fears are ancient and inexplicable. If the world is purely material, you can fight an earthly Hell by choosing good. If the world is not material, you are in the hands of God or the Devil. Choosing to do good will neither save nor damn you. It's the only game in town.

Movie data can be found [here](https://datasets.imdbws.com/). You'll want the files 'title.basics.tsv.gz' and 'title.ratings.tsv.gz'.\n",

    "Future users of this notebook should take care to note whether their database gives\n",

    "in the case where training data is sorted by review date. For all our initial models, however, we have elected\n",
    "not to pursue that approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two reasons for this:\n",

    "according to the order people watch them in. This has pros and cons. We don't want to provide recommendations \n",

The third dataframe records scoring from both metrics across all users you care to test.

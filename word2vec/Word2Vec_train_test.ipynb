    "1. A database with scraped movie reviews and movie data. See the Groa/web_scraping folder for a [scraper](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/Groa/blob/master/web_scraping/scraper.py) you can use to get the reviews. Movie data can be found [here](https://datasets.imdbws.com/). You'll want the files 'title.basics.tsv.gz' and 'title.ratings.tsv.gz'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Folders in the current working directory titled:\n",

    "         - It also contains /letterboxd and /imdb, where test data is saved for scoring various models. I have included my own data as an example of how to format any test data you can collect. The letterboxd data is just the unzipped Letterboxd export folder, exactly as it comes from the site.\n"

    "Future users of this notebook should take care to note whether their database gives\n",

    "within a 10-movie window. A non-random ordering may introduce a bias. This bias might improve the model, e.g. \n",
    "in the case where training data is sorted by review date. For all our initial models, however, we have elected\n",
    "not to pursue that approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two reasons for this:\n",
    "1. Ultimately, the user \"taste vector\" that is the input for making recommendations is\n",
    "a vector average of all the movies the user has watched, so it's not perfectly analogous to finding similar movies\n",
    "to a single movie.\n",
    "2. More importantly, sorting the training data by review date would influence the model to associate movies\n",
    "according to the order people watch them in. This has pros and cons. We don't want to provide recommendations \n",
    "that lead a user down a path that others have trodden, and this would seem to be one potential drawback. But further\n",
    "testing is needed. It might be a great idea."
